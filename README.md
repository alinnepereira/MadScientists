##Goals
Our group was tasked with investigating the change in allele frequency between Generation6 and Geneation12 of each replicate population,and to investigate across all generations if the change in allele frequency was random within the genome or specific to locations within the genome. 

##The Process
To begin the investigation of change in allele frequency between Generation6 and Generation12, all of the VCF files for Generation6 and Generation12 were [extracted](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Extract_my_sample.sh) from the master VCF file provided in the class shared folder. After extracting the individual VCF files, we generated VCF files with [ONLY SNPs](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Keep_SNPs.sh); therefore, all indels were removed. The [allelic freqeuncy](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/AlleleFrequency.sh) was obtained for all of the replicate populations at Generation6 and Generation12. To investigate the regions with the greatest change in allele frequency between Generation6 to Generation12, these files would have been uploaded to R to generate a [Manhattan-like plot](ManhattanPlot.R);  however, these files were not in the correct format, so Dr. Stevenson provided us with the correct format, a csv file. Five [Manhattan-like plots](Manhattan Plots.pdf) were produced for this time point for the five populations with a cutoff value of mean plus four times standard deviation. As a group, we were supposed to share VCF files containing [ONLY INDELs](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Keep_indels.sh) with "Snapes on a Plane", however, the master vcf file did not cotain INDELs. We were no longer responsible for this step; furthermore, it was unnecessary to extract only SNPs from our extracted sample VCF files which we had already completed. 

To investigate if the change in allele frequency was random within the genome or concentrated to specific sites in the genome, we constructed Venn diagrams.  To construct these Venn diagrams, we coordinated with "Snapes on a Plane" to obtain the positions in the genome that had the greatest change in allele frequency between Founder to Generation6 for all replicate populations and "The Ladies" to obtain the positions in the genome that had the greatest change in allele frequency between Generation12 and Generation18. These groups provided us with SNPs that were above our specified cutoff value (mean plus four times standard deviation) and the location on the chromosome where the SNP occurred. The regions with the greatest change in allele frequency were compared across all time points (Founder to Generation6, Generation6 to Generation12, and Generation12 to Generation18), which was displayed as a Venn diagram in R for each replicate population.  

Before creating the Venn diagrams, a [text file](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/tree/master/VennDiagramsTextFiles) had to be created for each of the five replicate populations so that the information would be in a readable format for R to create Venn diagrams. An additional [text file](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/VennDiagramsTextFiles/TopRep.txt) was also made to compare all of the top SNPs in all of the replicate populations (1, 2, 3, 5, and 7) across all time points for a larger compiled analysis. [Dr. Stephen Sefick's](http://www.auburn.edu/~sas0025/) [Automated_VennDiagram R script](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Automated_VennDiagram.R) and [VennDiagram_Raw.txt file](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/VennDiagram_Raw.txt) were used to generate the [Venn diagrams](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Venn%20Diagrams.pdf). Our replication population text file information was transposed into his VennDiagram_Raw.txt file to run the R script. Finally, a conclusion report was produced to analyze and answer the main goal of Step 5. A [conclusion report](Conclusion Report.pdf) was produced to analyze and answer the main goal of Step 5.
