Our group was tasked with investigating the change in allel freqneucy between Generation6 and Geneation12 of each replicate population,
and to investigate across all generations if the change in allele frequency was random within the genome or specific to location within the genome. 

To begine the investigation of change in SNPs between Generation6 and Generation12, all the replication population Generation6 and Generation12 vcf files were [extracted](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Extract_my_sample.sh) from the master vcf file. After extracting the individual vcf files, we generated vcf files only with [ONLY SNPs](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Keep_SNPs.sh) within them. The [allelic freqeuncy](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/AlleleFrequency.sh) was obtained for all the replication population Generation6 and Generation12. These files would have been uploaded to R to generate a [Manhattan-like plot]() to visualize the change in allelic frequency, however, these files were not in the correct format, so Dr. Stevenson provided us with the correct format a csv file. As a group, we were supposed to share vcf files containing [ONLY INDELs](https://github.com/AUIntroBioinformatics/MadScientists/blob/master/Keep_indels.sh) with "Snape on a Plane", however, the master vcf file did not conatin INDELs.

To investigate if the change in allele frequency was random within the genome or concentrated to specific sites in the genome, we constructed an R script to calculate the absolute value of the difference in allele frequency from Generation6 to Generation12. These values were then used to generate a Manhattan-like plot, which displays the change in allele frequency across the yeast genome. Five [Manhattan-like plots]() were produced for this time point for the five populations. We decided to use a cutoff value of mean plus four standard deviation to investigate the regions with the greatest change in allele frequency at this time point. We then instructed the other groups to provide us with their genomic positions that received a change in allele frequency above our specified cutoff. The regions with the greatest change in allele frequency were compared across all time points (Founder to Generation6, Generation6 to Generation12, and Generation12 to Generation18) which was displayed as a Venn diagram in R for each replicate population.
